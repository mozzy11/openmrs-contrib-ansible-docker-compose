## ID staging - keycloak and postfix

Details can be found [openmrs-contrib-itsm-id](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-contrib-itsm-id/tree/main). 

When this instance starts from an empty database, `realm-export.json` will be imported as `openmrs` realm. It can be accessed in `https://id-stg.openmrs.org` . This realm file is only imported if the realm doesn't already exist ([docs](https://www.keycloak.org/server/importExport#_importing_a_realm_during_startup))
 

The staging realm file was generated by exporting the production realm (including roles, groups or clients), and manually:  

  - Added STMP password
  - Changed LDAP url, and added LDAP password
  - Changed recaptcha secrets
  - Removed clients and user configuration needed by Atlassian suite login and talk (clients and users) 



Master domain can be access with username and password defined in `.env` file. It can accessed via `https://id-stg.openmrs.org/admin` . This is how one can apply changes to Keycloak. 

We are currently not doing backups on postgres, as most of the configurations can be loaded from the exported configuration file.
